          <img src="resources/images/pi-shades.jpg" alt="illustration about 50 Shades of Grey's Portland connection">
          <p>I created this photo illustration for an a&ampe Sunday cover of The Oregonian. I started with a photograph of the
            Made in Portland sign. I changed the words on the sign and photographed a ribbon that
            became the sash over the deer's eyes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-biz-pdx3.jpg" alt="Doubletruck for The Oregonian about Portland's changing skyline">
            <p>For this two-page spread, we stitched together dozens of photos taken from a helicopter to show Portland's
            changing skyline. The challenge was to get the wealth of
        information, including each building's location, function, height, number of units and development status,
        organized in a way that made the page inviting and approachable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-books.jpg" alt="illustration about the gender gap for the Oregon book awards">
            <p>Creativity can be more effective than technical tricks as I showed with this story on the gender gap
              in the Oregon Book Awards. I used my scissors and a couple of pages from a book to create the illustration.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-ae-tv.jpg" alt="Fall TV preview on the Sunday entertainment cover for The Oregonian">
            <p>I created this illustration for the a&ampe Sunday cover because, in Portland, the only thing more predictable
            than the arrival of new television shows each fall is the arrival of the rain.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-ae-summer.jpg" alt="Sunday entertainment cover for The Oregonian about things to do before summer ends">
            <p>The lightness and movement of this page do a great job of capturing the feeling of the story. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-f-tools.jpg" alt="Photo and graphic of useful kitchen tools">
            <p>This page delivers a lot of information and is easy to navigate.
              I assembled all the tools mentioned in the story and photographed them on my dining room table so that
              each description is aligned with the item discussed. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/cruise.jpg" alt="Travel cover for The Oregonian about cruising">
            <p>I art directed a freelancer to create the illustration for this page I designed about various types of cruises,
            from the newsest huge ocean liner to short overnight jaunts between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-f-waste.jpg" alt="Food cover for The Oregonian about reducing food waste">
            <p>I especially enjoy the challenge of working primarily with type. The directness of this package effectively makes
              the point of how serious a problem food waste is in this country.

          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-bbq.jpg" alt="illustration for bbq section">
            <p>For the cover of a&ampe's BBQ special issue, I wrote the section name, header and pig illustration with
            a squirt bottle full of BBQ sauce onto parchment paper and  photographed it. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-diner.jpg" alt="Cover of the Diner special section for The Oregonian">
            <p>As a designer, I know that sometimes the answer is to get out of the way of a mouthwatering photo.</p>

            <img src="resources/images/flyer-dahlia.jpg" alt="Flyer for Portland Garden Tour West">
            <p>At work I am designing for a mass-market audience, but sometimes at home
              I'm just designing a flyer for my daughter's school.</p>
