          <img src="resources/images/pi-shades.jpg" alt="illustration about 50 Shades of Grey's Portland connection">
          <p>I created this photo illustration for an a&ampe Sunday cover of The Oregonian. I started with a photograph of the
            Made in Portland sign. I changed the words on the sign and photographed a ribbon that
            became the sash over the deer's eyes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-biz-pdx2.jpg" alt="Doubletruck for The Oregonian about Portland's changing skyline">
            <p>For this two-page spread, we stitched together dozens of photos taken from a helicopter to show Portland's
            changing skyline. This package which took two broadsheet pages shows the different areas along the waterfront
          and the development planned for each. The challenge was to get the wealth of
        information, including each building's location, function, height, number of units and development status,
        oraganized in way that made the page inviting and approachable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-bbq.jpg" alt="illustration for bbq section">
            <p>For the cover of a&ampe's BBQ special issue, I wrote out the section name, header and pig illustration with
            a squirt bottle full of BBQ sauce onto parchment paper and then photographed it. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-ae-tv.jpg" alt="Fall TV preview on the Sunday entertainment cover for The Oregonian">
            <p>I created this illustration for the a&ampe Sunday cover because, in Portland, the only thing as predictable
            as the arrival of new television shows each fall is the arrival of the rain.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-books.jpg" alt="illustration about the gender gap for the Oregon book awards">
            <p>Creativity can trump technology. For a story on the gender gap in the Oregon Book Awards, I got out my scissors and couple pages from a book.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-ae-summer.jpg" alt="Sunday entertainment cover for The Oregonian about things to do before summer ends">
            <p>The lightness and movement of this page do a great job of capturing the feeling of the story. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/pi-f-tools.jpg" alt="Photo and graphic of useful kitchen tools">
            <p>This page delivers a lot of information and is easy to navigate.
              I assembled all the tools mentioned in the story on my dining room table so that
              each description is alligned with the item discussed. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-f-grill.jpg" alt="Food cover for The Oregonian about grilling">
            <p>Sometimes, a simple, boldly colored page is the way to catch someone's attention, like with this grill illustration I created for the Food section. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-f-waste.jpg" alt="Food cover for The Oregonian about reducing food waste">
            <p>I really enjoy the challenge of working primarily with type. The directness of this package effectively makes
              the point of how serious a problem food waste is in this country.

            <img src="resources/images/page-diner.jpg" alt="Cover of the Diner special section for The Oregonian">
            <p>As a designer, I know that sometimes the answer is to get out of the way of a mouth-watering photo.</p>

          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/flyer-dahlia.jpg" alt="Flyer for Portland Garden Tour West">
            <p>Even though for work I am designing for a mass-market audience, sometimes at home
              I'm just designing a flyer for my daughter's school.</p>
