          <img src="resources/images/pi-shades.jpg" alt="illustration about 50 Shades of Grey's Portland connection">
          <p>I created this photo illustration for an a&ampe Sunday cover of The Oregonian. I started with a photograph of the
            Made in Portland sign. I changed the words on the sign and I took a photogrpah of a gold ribbon that
            happened to be handy, changed its color in Photoshop and added it to the illustration.</p>

          <div class="item flex">
            <img src="resources/images/page-biz-pdx2.jpg" alt="Doubletruck for The Oregonian about Portland's changing skyline">
            <p>Dozens of photos taken from a helicopter were stitched together to create panoramas of Portland's
            changing skyline. This package which took two broadsheet pages shows the different areas along the waterfront
          and the development planned for each. The design challenge was to orangize all the disparate pieces of
        information and keep the page inviting and approachable.</p>

            <img src="resources/images/pi-bbq.jpg" alt="illustration for bbq section">
            <p>For the cover of a&ampe's BBQ special issue, I wrote out the section name, header and pig illustration with
            a squirt bottle full of bbq sauce onto parchment paper and then photographed it. </p>

            <p>Sometimes, a simple, boldly colored page is the way to catch someone's attention, like with this grill illustration I created for the Food section. </p>

            <img src="resources/images/pi-books.jpg" alt="illustration about the gender gap for the Oregon book awards">
            <p>Technology isn't always the answer. For a story on the gender gap in winners of the Oregon Book Awards, I got out my scissors and couple pages from a book.</p>

            <img src="resources/images/page-ae-summer.jpg" alt="Sunday entertainment cover for The Oregonian about things to do before summer ends">
            <p>The lightness and movement of this page do a great job of capturing the feeling of the story. </p>

            <p>This page has a lot of information to get across, but makes it easy to dive right in.
              I assembled all the tools mentioned in the story on my dining room table and photographed them so that
              each graph points right to the item discussed. </p>
